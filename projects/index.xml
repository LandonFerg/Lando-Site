      <description>Data-FX is a blender3d addon that adds the ability to load and visualize data using various different charts.
It started as a fun way to learn more about the Python language, but ended up being a fun ongoing side-project. Made originally for blender 2.9 but tested as far as Blender 3.4.

      <description>Position Based Dynamics This fluid sim runs entirely on the GPU using Unity Compute Shaders, implementing the method from this research paper. The current implementation uses a Bitonic sort for spatial hashing, though other parallel sorting algorithms could potentially offer better performance.
 GPU Handles Collisions Since the fluid system runs on the GPU, we have to represent physical objects as a set of particles on the GPU. I then just made a script that checks if an object is moving, if it is, we update the fluid collision particle positions.</description>

      <description>Overview The bar uses 6 servo-controlled valves to dispense the drinks, and 4 air pumps connected to a relay board to dispense the mixers.
Back-End For this project, I used Nodejs and the SocketIO library for realtime client &amp;gt; server communication.
The pi emits the local webserver you can connect to from any device on the network, including a windows tablet attatched to the bar.
The client then sends the drink selection data back to the server, and the server passes that data to a python script.</description>

      <description>I-Hear-Them is an in-browser 3D first-person horror test game made with ThreeJS with the help of some custom built shaders.
