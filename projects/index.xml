      <description>Overview The bar uses 6 servo-controlled valves to dispense the drinks, and 4 air pumps connected to a relay board to dispense the mixers.
Back-End For this project, I used Nodejs and the SocketIO library for realtime client &amp;gt; server communication.
The pi emits the local webserver you can connect to from any device on the network, including a windows tablet attatched to the bar.
The client then sends the drink selection data back to the server, and the server passes that data to a python script.</description>

      <description>Data-FX is a blender3d addon that adds the ability to load and visualize data using various different charts.
It started as a fun way to learn more about the Python language, but ended up being a fun ongoing side-project that I update regularly.
