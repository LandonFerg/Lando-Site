      <description>Data-FX is a blender3d addon that adds the ability to load and visualize data using various different charts.
It started as a fun way to learn more about the Python language, but ended up being a fun ongoing side-project. Made originally for blender 2.9 but tested as far as Blender 3.4.

      <description>Position Based Dynamics This fluid sim runs entirely on the GPU using Unity Compute Shaders, implementing the method from this research paper. The current implementation uses a Bitonic sort for spatial hashing, though other parallel sorting algorithms could potentially offer better performance.
 GPU Handles Collisions Since the fluid system runs on the GPU, we have to represent physical objects as a set of particles on the GPU. I then just made a script that checks if an object is moving, if it is, we update the fluid collision particle positions.</description>

      <description>Overview The bar uses 6 servo-controlled valves to dispense the drinks, and 4 air pumps connected to a relay board to dispense the mixers.
Back-End For this project, I used Nodejs and the SocketIO library for realtime client &amp;gt; server communication.
The pi emits the local webserver you can connect to from any device on the network, including a windows tablet attatched to the bar.
The client then sends the drink selection data back to the server, and the server passes that data to a python script.</description>

      <description>Saving Greg was my submission for the 48th bi-annual 48 hour game jam Ludum Dare. Here is a look back at what happened during those two days&amp;hellip;
What Is Greg? Greg is a phenomenon widely observed in my LD submissions. My crutch if you will. By throwing a bit of nonsensical mess into the jam at the very beginning, I find it helps me to not take this thing too seriously, and I usually end up with a patched-together game I can grow to like.</description>

      <title>Bayer Matrix Dithering in GLSL for Use in a Horror Game</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to replicate the beautiful dithering style used in the game Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope. I attempted to implement this type of 1 bit dithering in GLSL with limited experience with shaders, and I went down quite the rabbit hole.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t already know what dithering is:
Dithering is a method that is used to lessen color-banding in images by intentionally applying certain noise patterns.</description>

      <title>Geographic Coordinates to a 3D Sphere</title>

      <description>I had the idea to add support for longitude and latitude values for my Blender3d addon, Data-FX. The idea is to allow people to select their lon/lat values from a CSV file and have the program plot them onto a 3D sphere. (Or any other 3d representation of a map really but for now a sphere)
This seemed like an interesting challenge &amp;ndash; I attempted to plot some points around a globe.</description>

      <title>Data Visualization Addon for Blender3d</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the 3d vfx application Blender for quite some time now (since 2010ish) and decided it would be fun to mess around with it for some other use cases. Using it as a way to visualize data.
While Blender is commonly used as a tool for digital art, I thought it would be interesting to integrate some type of data loading/parsing. This would also help me hone my python skills.</description>
